## Election-Audit Summary:

### Use of PyPoll_Challenge for election
This script is very useful in determining any election turnout. We can study the candidates popularity as well as understand the political involvement of the population in each county. For example, in this election Denver had the highest percentage of votes, which shows that more people are involved in voting in Denver than other counties. 

We can make some small changes in the data and the script in order to provide more details to this analysis.

### Examples of modifying scripts
    * We could also add demography of the population in the data besides just the number of votes and use this information in the script. Once we have the demography of the voters in the script, we can easily combine  the race, age, and gender of candidates and find out for example, how many females or males voted. We can also find out which age group of the population votes the most. This will help the candidates to understand detailed information of the people casting votes. If candidates can understand the demography of the voters, they can reach out to their demography accordingly, thus helping them to win more votes.

    * We can also add the political party preference for each candidate in the data. Using this information we can print the total percentage of each political affiliation for each county. this will help us to understand the county's overall political party preference. This can assist the candidates to perform better in the election.
